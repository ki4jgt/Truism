# Centering

---

Stains on the heart,

Or do they call them scars?

The Truth within ourselves,

Tearing us apart.


You're supposed to feel this.

You're supposed to let it in.

The joy and the sadness,

Is where healing begins.


As you walk between the shadows.

May your Truth outshine all obstruction.
