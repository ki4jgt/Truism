# Death

Life is viewed as a centralized primitive which other primitives surround. Co-primitives reduce and increase their distance from this primary throughout time, which is also a collection of primitives.

Death is not destruction, as primitives are Truth, and Truth cannot be destroyed. Death (a primitive) is an obstruction of primitives remaining counited. It is possible that they're counited in a later place and time.
