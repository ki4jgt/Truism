# The Forbidden

Truism forbids revealing your Truist association to others, unless directly requested. After a request, revealing yourself is still discouraged, but Truth being all-powerful, it is best to be honest.

Because you cannot own anything, Truism is its own primitive. It is your job to care for it and shape it into something useful.
