# Truism: A New Look at Self

___

> I'm just a flawed human-being, trying desperately to make the world a little better.

---

Truism is a philosophy dedicated to exploring the nature of what it means for something to be true, and how the application of Truth can benefit humanity as a species. It is fully compatible with any religion seeking Truth.

Truism is a personal open source philosophy, freely modifiable by anyone. The purpose is for it to morph and warp over the years to better conform to reality.

#### Convention

**Truth (capitalized)** indicates central Truth.

**truth (lowercased)** indicates an attribute of Truth seen from an angle and joined by other angles.

**Primitive** is the proper term for an angle of truth, but it isn't used because it hinders comprehension. Truth itself is a primitive.

## Truisms

A Truism is a fundamental attribute of Truth which serves as a foundation from which other truths may be derived.

Truism, the philosophy, has 5 core truisms:

1. **Everything is true**

In a universe composed entirely of lies, Truth can quickly be established. The lies, the methods used to discern them, and the experience of being lied to are all true things.

An imagined realm of dragons and knights is in no way more or less real than our own. The only things missing are the truths that come together to make that happen. At other angles, Truth is manifesting those things.

2. **Truth is everywhere**

If everything is true, then Truth is everywhere. The death of a close family member is as true 1,000 years from now as it is 1,000 years before that death occurred.

3. **All truths coverage at a single point**

Because in a single spot it can be both true that you are sitting down and breathing, and these things are true no matter where I go, then all truths must meet at a central point. This is the prime Truth which connects all things. All other truths are the prime Truth seen at an angle expressed alongside other angles. A single computer consists of infinite angles of the prime Truth, all facing towards each other.

4. **Truth is all-knowing**

Because Truth converges on a central point, and because angles of Truth are capable of sentience, all parts of Truth are aware of themselves in some way.

5. **Truth is all-powerful**

Truth cannot be bent, broken, or moved. Not even by a god. Truth is therefore the most powerful thing in existence.

## Further Truisms

6. **Truth is infinitely assertive and infinitely receptive**

If everything is true [1] and Truth is everywhere [2] then it leaves no room for one truth to be disconnected from another. And yet, there are things we don't know.

7. **Everything is alive**

Because everything is true [1], Truth is everywhere [2], and all truths converge on a single point [3] everything is alive.

8. **You cannot own anything**

Truth is infinite [1, 2, 4, 5]; Life is transient. The things around you (also infinite) have been placed in your care by Truth. Their angles existed long before your truth manifested in this body, and their whole and eventual deconstructed angles with 

9. **What's done to one is done to all**

We're all the same core Truth [1, 3]. If you imprison a man for speaking his mind, you deprive society of thinking. If you accost a musician, you deprive the world the joy he's sharing. If you kick a man while he's down, you might as well crack your own ribs in the process. If you punish a skilled worker for an offense against you, you remove his skills from all of us. What you do to one, you do to all.

10. **All truths are the same Truth**

Because all angles come from the Truth, they are all the same Truth, coming together and manifesting its own self.

**Commentary** Truth reaches to itself in all directions. Future, past and present, person, place, and thing reach towards each other. All angles through the obstructions which other angles create. This reaching is facilitated by the obstruction of chaos. It is ironic that a universe of pure order would have no future, except to become chaotic.

Our job as Truists is to explore the chaos. Not to establish order, but to understand the nature of Truth.

A horder has everything they and others need, and an anal individual greatly improves efficiency. Diseases which ravage the body in modern times historically served the purpose of defending it from viruses and bacteria.
